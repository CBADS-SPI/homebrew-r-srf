# homebrew-r-srf

Custom hombrew r formula. Tcl-tk support is added using the Mac OS system tcl-tk framework (formula lines 63-65). Mac OS Command Line Tools must be installed for the appropriate Tcl-tk config files to be available. XQuartz/X11 is also necessary for Tcl-tk. 

Additional compile options are available by editing the formula and commenting/uncommenting the relevant lines. See formula text for further detail surrounding compilation options.
